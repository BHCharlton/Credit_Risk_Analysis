# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
There are several different tools and datasets available to help determine credit risk in the financial industry.  In this project, we used Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to help in predicting this risk.  Here are some of the procedures that were used:
* Oversampling the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
* Undersampling the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
* A combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN
* Compare the classifiers BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, which help to reduce bias in machine learning

The results from each algorithm are then compared to help make the best reccommendation for predicting credit risk
